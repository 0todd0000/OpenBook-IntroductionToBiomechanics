    "    * Since external forces are required to accelerate the body's COM, muscle contraction can affect whole-body COM motion **if and only if** (a) the body is in contact with an external surface **and** (b) the surface produces a reaction force against the body.\n",
    "        * For example, when sitting on a swivel chair, raise your feet off the ground and rotate your trunk in the transverse plane;  it is not possible to rotationally accelerate your whole body! When you rotate your upper body, your lower body will rotate in the opposite direction, giving your whole body zero angular acceleration.\n",
    "        * If instead you put your feet on the ground, it is easy to rotationally accelerate your whole body;  this is because the external ground reaction forces accelerate your body\n",
