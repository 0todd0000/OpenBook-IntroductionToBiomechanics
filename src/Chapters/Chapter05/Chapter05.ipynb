    "* 3D linear motion is relatively easy, and not much more difficult than 2D linear motion\n",
    "* 3D motion, in general, is difficult to visualize\n",
    "* 3D rotations are confusing!\n",
    "* Many different methods exist for quantifying 3D rotations including especially: rotation matrices, quaternions and Euler angles\n",
    "* No method is perfect: each method has advantages and disadvantages\n",
    "* Scientific analyses of human movement usually use Euler angles because they can generally be interpreted more easily than other 3D rotation quantifications "
