    "* The BVH format was developed by a company called \"Biovision\"; although this company no longer exists, the BVH format has persisted in many motion capture applications and software systems.\n",

    "* A wide variety of software systems support the BVH format, including [Blender](https://www.blender.org) (see [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biovision_Hierarchy) for additional software packages that support BVH).\n",
    "* The main **advantages** of the BVH format are:\n",
    "    * Data are saved in text files, meaning that they are universally shareable.\n",
    "    * Data are described in a clear joint hierarchy, making them convenient for creating animations.\n",
    "* The main **disadvantages** of the BVH format are:\n",
    "    * High sampling rates (e.g. 100 Hz or more ) can produce very large BVH files; this is inconvenient for scientific applications.\n",
    "    * Marker data are not supported; most motion capture systems start with marker positions, and then calculate joint angles. Since BVH data start with joint angles, there is no way to re-calculate joint angles if a mistake is found in the original calculations, or if a better method becomes available.\n",
    "* Useful addtional information about BVH data is available at [this University of Wisconsin site](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html) (from a university lecture website entitled: \"Topics in Computer Animation\")\n"
